\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present \system, an execution platform on NetFPGA SUME for serverless computation. \system enables processing arbitrary network service code that is offloaded to the NetFPGA.  
\system presented key system components (DM\_FIFO, virtual pipelined engine, maps, double buffer system, and scheduler) to enable serverless computing.
Moreover, with its protocol-independent packet processor, eBPFlow enables incorporating protocols that do not yet exist.
\system demonstrated that NetFPGA offload can improve energy-efficiency, consuming 75\% less energy than an idle CPU.
Furthermore, it operates at line rate.
We plan to make the eBPFlow implementation publicly available.
